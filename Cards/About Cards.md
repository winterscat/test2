up:: [[ACCESS 笔记组织法]]

虽然叫[[永久笔记]]permanent note ，但个人理解其实更贴切的翻译是常青笔记evergreen note。一来，根据形式，和[[闪念笔记]]与[[文献笔记]]区分开。二来，根据目的，它是永恒且发展的，能为将来所用的永久笔记。

暂时先把日常片段式的思考和闪念，以短小的[[卡片笔记]]的方式，直接丢到这里，不强调文件夹分类，而是尝试通过特殊文件名、标签和链接等方式，让这些笔记具备可发现性，更容易被将来的自己找到。

这里的[[MOC]]是事后总结归纳，不强调完备性。

一些临时的，pending的又不舍得删除的笔记先放到Pending文件夹里，等以后再处理。

The cards folder is one of my favorite places because it has **umami**. Apparently umami is one of the five basic tastes. There are: Sweetness, Sourness, Saltiness, Bitterness, and that oddball Umami.

Umami is hard to describe but you know when it's there. The same is true of this folder's contents. It's a mixture of insights and ideas, concepts and connections, all mingling together to create that mysterious full mouthfeel that magnificently completes any meal for the mind.

You may have a few subfolders here too. I have a "People" subfolder. If I was an amateur chef with a growing number of recipe notes, I'd put a "Recipes" folder here. If I was making building a personal library of important exercises, I'd likely make an "Exercises" folder.

So, what are "cards"? Anything that is a bit of knowledge that you might call a "thing" or a "statement about things".

Yes, the definition is not rigid, but it works.
