# Library

Navigate your library of maps with a classification system made for PKM.

This is a ready-made scaffolding that can hold your diverse interests. Try to only populate it with interests where you actually have some zest and zeal.

### The LYT Classification System

While I encourage you to fully customize your **home** note, I urge you to start building your library using the **LYT Classification System**.

The **LYT Classification System** is lightly modified from the Cutter, Dewey, and Universal Decimal classification systems used in libraries around the world. It will provide you a time-tested foundation as you structure the interests of your digital library.

| Section | Description |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 000 | Knowledge Management |
| 100 | Personal Management |
| 200 | Philosophy & Psychology; Spirituality & Religion |
| 300 | Social Sciences |
| 400 | Communications & Rhetoric; Language & Linguistics |
| 500 | Natural Sciences |
| 600 | Applied Sciences |
| 700 | Art & Recreation |
| 800 | Literature |
| 900 | History & Biography & Geography |

## 000 - Knowledge Management

The [[My PKM MOC (Kit)]] shows the best practices of knowledge management. I use the [[LYT Kit]] to show the power of linked thinking and to empower others to develop their thinking. The [[Mapping MOCs]] is my personal note to wrap my head around the wondrous beauty that MOCs offer. Others include:

- [[Knowledge and memory MOC]]

## 100 - Personal Management

The [[Thinking]] MOC can galvanize my attention; the [[Concepts MOC]] can flavor it; and the [[Habits MOC]] speaks about how to direct it. Underpinning all is my [[Cabin ü™µ]] note. Go to [[Life Space‚Ñ¢ (Kit)]] to see the [[Virtue List]] and more.

Others: [[Posture MOC]] and [[Hormesis MOC]] and [[Breathing Exercises MOC]].

## 200 - Philosophy ü§î, Psychology üß†; Spirituality üôè , Religion „ä™

Is there no limit to this section? I use [[Philosophy MOC (Kit)]] as the big note and then point to things like: [[Stoicism MOC]], [[Confucianism MOC]], [[Religion MOC]], [[Taoism MOC]], and whatever else comes up.

[[Psychology MOC (Kit)]] is similar but different enough to have its own space.

## 300 - Social Sciences üë•

*The study of human society and of individual relationships in and to society.*

While this a very important section, I have found it's a bit more intimate, as strange as that sounds, so I'm hesitant to share too much here. That said, the [[People MOC]] is special note, along with [[Prominent People üåã]].

I suppose I'll leave the [[Commonplace Book üìñ]] here for now.

See also: Politics | Society | Law | Relationships

## 400 - Communications & Rhetoric; Language & Linguistics üó£

A fun section of the library, the 400s contains the underrated and oft-maligned subject of [[Rhetoric MOC]]. And one cannot talk long about rhetoric without talking about [[Language MOC]], [[Words MOC]], and especially [[Figures MOC]]. Not too far behind is the [[Leadership MOC]].

## 500 - Natural Sciences

A sharp break from the previous section, the 500s explores the natural world and universe in glorious notes like [[Cosmology MOC]] and [[Math MOC]].

See also: Chemistry | Geology | Plants | Animals

## 600 - Applied Sciences

A natural progression from the previous section, this is where we take thet the fundamentals of nature and *apply* them. My undergrad was in [[Engineering MOC]], which relates to my interest in [[Building Homes MOC]]. Later on, I developed the [[Editing Manual MOC]].

See also: Agriculture | Technology | Medical | [[AI MOC]] |Programming | [[Collective Intelligence MOC]] | [[Genetics MOC]] | [[Systems MOC (Kit)]]

## 700 - Art & Recreation

Ah the leisures of life. Remember leisure? Few really do. This section could easily balloon.

- Art MOC | [[Design MOC]] | Architecture | Painting |
- Film & TV | [[Movies MOC]]
- Sports | [[Football MOC]]
- Music | [[Jazz MOC]] |[[Vocals MOC]]
- [[Cooking MOC]] | Leisure
- `#source/movieüé¨` | `#source/tvüé¨` | `#source/musicüéµ`

## 800 - Literature

If folks barely remember leisure, they likely completely forgot about classical literature. A great shame, neomania‚Ä¶we blind ourselves to some of humanity's greatest hits. Use [[Literature MOC]] as a launchpad.

## 900 - History & Biography & Geography

I've noticed I'm naturally building up the [[Ancient Greece MOC]], but I haven't cared to build out the [[History MOC]] just yet. The [[Places MOC]] is a peculiarly powerful note that has big things in store for it.

The [[Art & Science Storytelling MOC]] look at some great storytellers of history.

## Commentary

Please don't go overboard with numbering things. We‚Äôre just using a basic pre-made map as a fixed *spatial constellation* upon which to easily add dots of new interests. Too much structure stifles innovation and organic, emergent growth.
